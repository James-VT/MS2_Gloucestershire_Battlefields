# Gloucestershire Battlefields

# Project overview

This website serves as the main page of a small, charitable organisation that looks after, researches and provides information on sites of historical military significance in Gloucestershire and neighbouring areas. The aims of the site owners are to relay information on battles and battlefields, provide information to site visitors about which sites they can visit and how to do so, and to generate revenue through donations. A visitor to the site will want to learn information about the county's military history and its significant sites, which ones they can visit and how to do so, and will potentially want to donate after a good experience.

# UX
The primary aim of the Gloucestershire Battlefields website is information - for the site owners, it is to relay information while for the site users, it is to obtain information. A user will want to see the range of battlefields across the county and learn about them - possibly with a view to visiting one or more of them - and will want to select which ones to learn information about. The site owners will want to provide a positive experience for the users in order to raise awareness of the sites they look after, and potentially to raise revenue via donations.

## User stories
### A visitor to the site will want to:
1. Learn the history of a specific battlefield. They have probably landed on the site due to searching for a specific one.
2. Learn the specific location of a battlefield, perhaps with a view to visiting.
3. Learn about the organisation behind the website and the raising of awareness of the battlefields themselves.
4. Read about a new battlefield, different to the one for which they first visited the site.
5. Donate to the charity that owns the site.

### A site owner will want to:
6. Relay information about the battlefields the charity looks after and promotes.
7. Visually display the locations of battlefields on the interactive map.
8. Relay information about their charity, and the work they do.
9. Present images to the visitor appropriate to the battlefield selected.
10. Raise revenue via donations.

# The Five Planes of User Experience Development
As part of the planning for this project, I have run through the stages of User Experience Design, as proposed by Jesse James Garrett.

## The Strategy plane
Beginning with the strategy plane, considered who might use this website and why; both site visitors and site owners. The goal of the site owners is to raise awareness of battlefields and sites of historical military significance within Gloucestershire and the surrounding area, and potentially to generate some revenue via donations. Visitors come to the site because they want to learn about specific battlefields and parts of history.

## The Scope Plane
The project's scope is chiefly threefold: the primary objective is the exchange of information about Gloucestershire's battlefields between site owner and site user. The second is the raising of revenue for the charity via donations, but this is achieved off the back of the first objective. The third is the relaying of information about the charity themselves.

## The Structure Plane
My wireframes can be found below. These have been constructed with the idea that mobile design should come first, and that the main aim from the point of the view of the site owner is the relaying of information in an interactive fashion that presents the basic facts, a narrative of the events, and the location on a map.

## The Skeleton Plane
The site's information is structured in such a way as to make the map primary; it is the first thing a user will see upon loading the page, and the cascading information resulting from clicking a button or location of a battle appears underneath the map itself. The difference at smaller screen sizes may be (depending on the precise size) the changing of the layout of the buttons.

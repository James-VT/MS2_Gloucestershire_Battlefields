# Gloucestershire Battlefields

# Project overview

This website serves as the main page of a small, charitable organisation that looks after, researches and provides information on sites of historical military significance in Gloucestershire and neighbouring areas. The aims of the site owners are to relay information on battles and battlefields, provide information to site visitors about which sites they can visit and how to do so, and to generate revenue through donations. A visitor to the site will want to learn information about the county's military history and its significant sites, which ones they can visit and how to do so, and will potentially want to donate after a good experience.

# UX
The primary aim of the Gloucestershire Battlefields website is information - for the site owners, it is to relay information while for the site users, it is to obtain information. A user will want to see the range of battlefields across the county and learn about them - possibly with a view to visiting one or more of them - and will want to select which ones to learn information about. The site owners will want to provide a positive experience for the users in order to raise awareness of the sites they look after, and potentially to raise revenue via donations.

## User stories
### A first time user will want to:
1. Learn the history of a specific battlefield. They have probably landed on the site due to searching for a specific one.
2. Expand their curiosity beyond just one battle. Seeing the simple and intuitive interactivity of the website, they may decide to learn about some other nearby battlefields, as well.
3. Learn the specific location of a battlefield, perhaps with a view to visiting.
4.

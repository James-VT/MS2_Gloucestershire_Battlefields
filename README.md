# Gloucestershire Battlefields

# Project overview

This website serves as the main page of a small, charitable organisation that looks after, researches and provides information on sites of historical military significance in Gloucestershire and neighbouring areas. The aims of the site owners are to relay information on battles and battlefields, provide information to site visitors about which sites they can visit and how to do so, and to generate revenue through donations. A visitor to the site will want to learn information about the county's military history and its significant sites, which ones they can visit and how to do so, and will potentially want to donate after a good experience.

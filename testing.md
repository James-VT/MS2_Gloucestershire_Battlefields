# Testing

### Linked script testing

As you can see in the picture, the first function in my site that I tested was whether the buttons registered a click properly. This was partly to test the buttons themselves, but also to test whether I had correctly linked my JavaScript file to my index.html file. As such, I wrote the code below in battlefields.js:

```
// The below is to test whether this file in linked properly to the index.html file
// and its button elements

let button = document.getElementById("tewkesbury-button");

function buttonTest() {
    console.log("button clicked");
}

button.addEventListener('click', buttonTest);
```

As you can see from the image below, the test was successful.

### Race condition bug

A bug I faced when working with the Google Maps API was due to what I later learned was a "race condition." When loading the live page or the port 8000 test page, the map would show on some page loads but not others. When the map failed to load, I noted the following two errors in the console:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: google is not defined
    at myMap (battlefields.js:40)
    at battlefields.js:53
```

```
Uncaught (in promise) hf {message: "initMap is not a function", name: "InvalidValueError", stack: "Error\n    at new hf (https://maps.googleapis.com/mâ€¦yZ-4&callback=initMap&libraries=&v=weekly:160:155"}
```

Thinking at first that this was to do with the restrictions on the API key, I first tried changing those, but this did not work. I then consulted fellow CI students on Slack, which turned up an interesting result. Below is my original HTML code for the Google Maps API:

```
<script
      src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap&libraries=&v=weekly"
      async
    ></script>
```

As identified by fellow student Sean Young, the attribute of "async" at the end of the script was causing the issue. The reason for this is that async is short for asynchronous loading. This attribute tells the browser to begin loading the next line of code as soon as this one has started loading, instead of waiting for it to finish. This means the script can sometimes load satisfactorily, and sometimes not. It comes down to a race between whether the script containing the API key loads first, or the script that constructs the map loads first. If the former happens, the map loads and works just fine. If not, then the problem I've described is what you're faced with.

#### Problem solved. The solution: remove the async attribute from the HTML.

### Score incrementation bug

While trying to get the score to increment properly on the quiz, I came across an issue whereby the score counter, presented as 0/6 upon the game's initialisation, would merely change to "1" on clicking the first correct answer, "2" on the second, etc.

Upon re-running the code after coming back from eating dinner, it worked perfectly.

#### Problem solved. The solution: do nothing and come back later.

### Hover animation delay/glitch

After adding a mouseenter/mouseleave event handler to my image links in index.html, I noticed that if I moved the mouse too quickly - really not very quickly at all - the animation broke. It would cease to respond to the mouse entering or leaving the element, and if any response came at all it could take up to five seconds after leaving the element to realise the mouse had even entered it. The code looked like this:

```
$(document).ready(function() {
    $(".index-menu-image").mouseenter(function() {
        $(this).animate({opacity: "0.2"});
    $(".index-menu-image").mouseleave(function() {
        $(this).animate({opacity: "1"});
    })
});
```
As you can see, this block of code uses mouseenter and mouseleave. To try something else, I wrote the same bit of code again but this time using a hover event handler instead of mouseenter and mouseleave:

```
$(document).ready(function() {
    $(".index-menu-image").hover(function() {
        $(this).animate({opacity: "0.2"});
    },
    function() {
        $(this).animate({opacity: "1"})
    })
});
```
This allowed me to roll everything into one function, rather than two. This works much better, allowing the animation to react to much quicker movements. If it needs to catch-up, it can now do so without getting broken.

#### Problem solved. The solution: use hover instead of mouseenter/mouseleave.

## Testing JavaScript with JSHint.

The JavaScript files used in this project were tested using JSHint (link in README, technologies used section).
